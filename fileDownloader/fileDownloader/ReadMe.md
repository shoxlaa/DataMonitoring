# It read me File 

Firstly i will tell about my coding style wrting and architecture that i am using 

I am creating application with using MVVM (Model View  ViewModel) architecture. In my opinion it is not the best but very flexiable  solution 
It is neccessary to understand that  the time of writing code is  more than in other architectures  but in the future if i want  to add something or to change the function , add inheretance and etc it will be easier 


In my interest the writing clean and readable  code with good documentation is neccessary 



The tools  -> MVVM Toolkit  

Easier and cleaner code 



In MVVM architect i added the factory method to creat the View Models
